## Hey-Day-Script
# Hey Day
This script was created to celebrate Hey Day at Auburn. Hey Day is an opportunity for everyone to feel like they belong on campus. Everyone can wear a nametag and say hey to others they see on Hey Day. This tradition was started to welcome back students who served in World War II. Since 1947, Hey Day has grown into an event that everyone looks forward to. This year Hey Day is October 16th. More information can be found here: https://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/ 
This script can be used to participate in Hey Day with a computer.
